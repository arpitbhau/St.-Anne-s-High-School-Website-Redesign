          <p>Life is a gift from God Almighty and it is the responsibility of every human being to make it a gift to God. St.Anne'sHigh School, Warorafollowing our motto “Love and Service” guides every child who enters our portals, to make their academic years the best channel to realize the best in them- mind, body, soul and spirit and thus to make it a gift to God and to the society through right thoughts, right actions, right behaviour and proactive and productive life.The same is resonated in the words of Mahatma Gandhi who said “education is the realization of the best in man - body, soul and spirit.</p>
          <p>Quality is not an act, it is a habit, says Aristotle. We insist on 'quality' as the integral part and centre of every endeavour. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru the first Prime Minister of independent India said, “Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself”. We help every Annite inculcate values from class room as a learning portal.</p>
          <p>One of the important aims of school education is the training for leadership in the profession and public life. We inspire the Annites and provide ample forums to become effective leaders - leaders who will lead and follow in their professional world and public life and in their own family being the best, being a blessing for everyone who is part of their life. The Annite ambience foster in the teachers and students and through them in society the ethics and values needed for developing and maintaining the good life that every human being aspires for.</p>
          <p>In the journey of empowering every student, we help them to move from 'Good to better, better to best' as the saying goes in the words of St. Jerome “never ever let it rest, till your good is better and your better is best”.</p>
          <p>Welcome to every child who aspires to be part of this Annite family at St.Anne'sHigh School, Warora.</p>

        <h2>HISTROY</h2>  
        <p>St.Anne's High School, at Warora is founded and managed by the Religious Society of the Sisters of St.Anne, Bangalore. One of the vision of our founder Msgr. Stephen Louis Charbonnaux was to reach out to women and in particular through education to the children for their empowerment.</p>
        <p>The society had its origin in Bangalore, and its headquarters situated at 2 miller Road, in Bangalore city.It has its branches spread all over India, Germany, America and Africa .The society responded to the frequent requests of the locals especially by the parents of st.Anne'svoltas and started schoolin 1994.The management's thrust is on its founding Charism and the emphasis is on the goals and objectives set for the holistic development of children.. The holistic development involves our participation in our nation's dreams and aspirations. Thus we dedicate ourselves for the promotion of national integration, religious harmony and secularism.</p>
        <p><strong>Our Founder- Rt.Rev.Bishop Stephen Louis Charbonnaux - Our Inspiration</strong></p>
        <p>Christ is a teacher par excellence. He is our supreme teacher and inspiration. His words are the lamp to our feet and light to our path. He is our perfect model of love and service. St. Anne is an excellent teacher who prepared Mother Mary to become the Mother of Jesus Christ. She is a committed, loyal, and wise teacher. The School is dedicated to her. We draw from her the inspiration of commitment, loyalty and affinity. Rt. Rev. Bishop Stephen Louis Charbonnaux of the Paris Missions is the founder of St.Anne's congregation, Bangalore(S.A.B). He was the first vicar of Mysore Mission who mastered all the South Indian languages. He is our source of inspiration as the seminal influence of his vision and dreams permeate through our lives and activities today.</p><br>
